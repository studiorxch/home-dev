  Lo-fi textures set the foundation with vinyl crackles, warm keys, and filtered samples, The beat is built on a punchy, syncopated, uptempo rhythm using crisp snares and energetic hi-hats, Layer in bold synth stabs and brassy hits, supporting a confident, uplifting lead melody

  [Intro: crowd murmur] [Verse: retro swing beat, filtered horns] [Bridge: drum solo blip] [Outro: arcade fade]
