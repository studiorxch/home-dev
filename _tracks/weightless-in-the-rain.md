title: Weightless In The Rain
permalink: /tracks/weightless-in-the-rain/
description: "A dreamy lo‑fi synthscape that drifts between fog and memory. Analog bass hums under dusty drums, while detuned reverse piano notes ripple like puddles. Faint NYC street sounds seep through, grounding the haze in real time. The track carries a nostalgic soulfulness, equal parts tender and tense — like wandering alone through a city downpour with headphones as your only umbrella."
