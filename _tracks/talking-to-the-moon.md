description: "A hypnotic lo-fi dance groove where a modded accordion snarls over warm analog bass and dusty Linn-style drums. Industrial textures, glitch accents, and Phrygian-tinted progressions build cinematic tension at a mid-tempo 106 BPM — underground energy with a heavy, swaggering pulse."

  [Intro]
  [distorted accordion drone + analog fuzz, subkick heartbeat, metallic hats with delay, low industrial hum]

  [dusty Linn snare, deep vinyl kick, syncopated groove, subby Moog bass glide, minor pentatonic accordion riff with tremolo flutter, whispered breath textures]

  [Chorus A]
  [A→Bb→G progression on accordion pads + FM synth growl, doubled accordion/guitar harmonics, glitch dropouts, heavy kick pulse]

  [Bridge A]
  [bass + floor tom groove, accordion ostinato filter-swept low to high, dark filtered synth swells with shimmer tails]

  [Verse B]
  [driving 1/8 bass pulse sidechained to kick, call-and-response accordion and synth brass hits, crisp rimshots, rewind-tape glitch transitions]

  [Chorus B]
  [full mix — distorted accordion, synth pads, bass, layered metallic snares, sudden silence bar → slam back in]

  [Bridge B]
  [accordion slow motif, modular synth spiral, minimal kick + shakers, suspense snare rolls, bass filter opening before drop]

  [Final Chorus]
