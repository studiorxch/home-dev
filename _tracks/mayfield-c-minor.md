title: Mayfield (C-Minor)
permalink: /tracks/mayfield-c-minor/
description: "A high‑tempo twist on the Mayfield loop — nostalgic lo‑fi textures reimagined with urgency. Faded synthwave layers and dusty cassette crackle ride over 178 BPM drums, sharper and more insistent than its D‑Minor sibling. Dreamy emotion still lingers in the haze, but the pulse here is restless, energetic, and slightly aggressive — like memory on fast‑forward."
