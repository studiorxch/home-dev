  Warm, dusty analog keys and muted drum loops set a laid-back lo-fi groove, Layered vinyl crackle pervades the track, gently side-chained beneath mellow guitar riffs and lush synth pads, Subtle tape warble and soulful electric piano enrich the texture throughout, evoking nostalgia

  [Intro: soft rewind FX] [Verse: nostalgic synth pads, mellow keys] [Bridge: chord shimmer] [Outro: long fade tape hiss]
