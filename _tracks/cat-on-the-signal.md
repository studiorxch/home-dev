title: Cat on the Signal
permalink: /tracks/cat-on-the-signal/
description: "Off-kilter bedroom pop meets chillhop minimalism. Lo-fi textures pulse gently with analog fuzz, layered beneath soft jazzy chords and sputtering vinyl crackles. Bass loops twist just off-tempo, giving the track a living, unstable rhythm. Vocals, if present, are hushed and syrupy, hiding under reverbed pads and tape flutter. It’s a dreamy feedback loop—warm, weird, and weightless."
