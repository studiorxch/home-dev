title: "Before the Pocket"
permalink: /tracks/before-the-pocket-s01/
description: "A glitchy lo-fi noir piece built from Soviet navigation tech lore: warped dial-tone static, noir organ grooves, analog synth dust, and haunted vocal fragments. The beat unfolds in shifting verses of cassette rewinds, rotary feedback, and a final unresolved click—glitchy ambient memory from before the age of pocket-sized devices."

  [Intro]
  [dial-tone static + warped bootup chime]
  [glitchy vocal fragment whisper: “...before apps, there were artifacts...” trailing into reverb]

  [Verse A]
  [mechanical lo-fi groove, ticking like analog gears]
  [organ keys loop: Cmin7 → F7 → Gdim7, noir-tinged]
  [bassline soft + hesitant, mimicking boot sequences]
  [sound FX: cassette rewind, faint keypad clacks]

  [Bridge A]
  [drums halftime, rotary feedback pulses]
  [filtered synth bloom like LED flickers in the dark]
  [vocal fragment: “...carry this?” reversed + slowed]

  [Verse B]
  [beat regains momentum, richer synths enter with dusty clarity]
  [sampled phrase from a 90s tech ad, distorted]
  [ambient textures: zip of a velcro pouch, CRT whirr, distant modem chirps]

  [Bridge B]
  [drums mute — eerie pads swirl, mimicking a device scan loop]
  [vocal callback: “...before the pocket...” in a fading chant]
  [last chord unresolved, like a feature left unlaunched]

  [Outro]
  [beat disintegrates into a UI click → tone loop → silence]
  [tape stop with final whisper: “not yet pocket-sized…”]
