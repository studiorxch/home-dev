title: Ghost Train To Hawkins
permalink: /tracks/ghost-train-to-hawkins/
description: "A gritty lo‑fi ride through shadows and static. Dusty drums and analog warmth rumble like wheels on old tracks, while haunting pads and reverse piano echoes flicker in the dark. The atmosphere feels moody, nostalgic, and quietly defiant — a spectral train carrying fragments of memory through empty stations and sleepless towns."
