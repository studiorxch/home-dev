title: Nowhere Shortcut S01
permalink: /tracks/nowhere-shortcut-s01/
description: "A chaotic lo‑fi sketch that hits like a missed turn at high speed. Tire‑screech FX kick open the loop, tumbling into chopped‑up jazz kit drums and a thick bassline that barely holds the ground. Shimmering detune bends time before the outro exhales into breathy reverb. Fleeting, unstable, and sharp — a shortcut that was never really there."
