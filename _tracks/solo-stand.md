  Lo-fi textures and subtle vinyl crackle open the track, layered with mellow piano chords and a gentle, syncopated drum loop, Swelling strings and atmospheric synths gradually enter, adding cinematic depth, The groove sways with vintage bass, culminating in a resolute, uplifting climax

  [Intro: wind against fence] [Verse: hazy beat, bright synths] [Bridge: minor bend tones] [Outro: long fade]
