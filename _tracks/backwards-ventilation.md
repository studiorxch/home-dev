title: Backwards Ventilation
permalink: /tracks/backwards-ventilation/
description: "*Backwards Ventilation* kicks off with a memory on rewind—reverse pianos curling over crackled vinyl dust. The swing stumbles just right, like it’s up to something. Minimal drums, ghosted reverb, and a rhythm that taps like spray cans on a quiet block. Feels like a prank in slow motion—mischievous, dusty, and full of bounce."
