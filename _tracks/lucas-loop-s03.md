description: "“Lucas Loop S03” is a memory dissolving in sound. The verse drifts with faded, echoing guitar lines layered over a retro lo-fi beat — like the hum of a cassette left too close to the sun. A synth bridge melts into place, soft and dissolving, before the outro swirls away in ambient haze. This loop feels like flipping through old photographs until they blur, carried by warmth and imperfection."
