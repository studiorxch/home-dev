description: "“A New Dawn” is a dreamy lo-fi ambient track shaped by muted reverse piano notes, soft tape hiss, and swirling analog synths. Its layered textures create an emotional, nostalgic atmosphere — equal parts soothing and reflective. With its gentle pacing and warm tonal palette, the track feels like first light breaking through memory, inviting stillness and calm. A piece for quiet mornings, deep focus, or late-night introspection."
