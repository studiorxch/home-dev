permalink: /tracks/empty-hall-echo-s01/
description: "“Empty Hall Echo S01” is lo-fi as absence — a surreal emptiness that lingers more than it plays. The intro unfolds with hallway ambience, a hollow reverb that sets the stage for sparse piano notes echoing against broken drum kit textures. A fragile bridge unravels into an ambient tape tear, and the outro fades into a bloom of silence that feels as alive as the sound before it."
