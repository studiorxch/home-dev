permalink: /tracks/brotherhood-beat-s04/
description: "Brotherhood Beat flows like a faded home video—warm lo-fi textures meet soft percussion, layered guitars, and gentle synth pads. It’s a low-lit loop of subtle camaraderie, stitched with tape hiss and quiet transitions. The drum groove walks with care, while airy keys and walkie-talkie glitches nod to lost conversations and shared stillness."
