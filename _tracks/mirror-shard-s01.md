permalink: /tracks/mirror-shard-s01/
description: "A fractured lo‑fi experiment where shards of sound refract like broken glass. Ticking percussion and glassy synth leads pulse against abstract pacing, pulling back into a soft ambient shimmer. It’s music that feels like memory in fragments — delicate, sharp, and strangely beautiful."
