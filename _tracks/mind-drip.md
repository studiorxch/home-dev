title: Mind Drip
permalink: /tracks/mind-drip/
description: "“Mind Drip” is a dreamy lo-fi ambient track built on muted reverse piano notes and soft tape hiss. Layers of haze drift gently through the mix, creating a meditative, introspective mood. The minimal textures and fluid pacing evoke a sense of stillness, as if sound itself were dissolving in slow motion. A short but immersive piece that captures lo-fi’s atmospheric side — perfect for night listening, reflective writing, or letting thoughts wander."
