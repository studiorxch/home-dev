  Warm lo-fi textures set the tone with laid-back drums, soft vinyl crackle, and mellow jazz-inspired keys, Gentle bass and understated guitar lines weave in quietly, Loose group harmonies in the hook add crew-like closeness, fading with a nuanced, wistful outro
  [Intro: group chatter FX] [Verse: vinyl rhythm, electric jazz keys] [Bridge: tone descent] [Outro: home fade]
