title: Fade Out Glow S04
permalink: /tracks/fade-out-glow-s04/
description: "“Fade Out Glow: S04” lays down a laid-back lo-fi groove with hazy, downtempo drums and deep, rounded bass. Warm, slightly detuned electric piano and subtle vinyl crackle create a vintage texture, while soft guitar riffs and fluttering synth accents drift in and out, adding a nostalgic shimmer. The result is a mellow, memory-soaked track that feels like a glowing fade at the end of a film reel — timeless, tactile, and perfect for late-night listening or quiet reflection."
