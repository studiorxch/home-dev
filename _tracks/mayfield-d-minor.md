permalink: /tracks/mayfield-d-minor/
description: "A dreamy lo‑fi beat drifting in faded synthwave textures. Dusty cassette crackle and mellow drums carry a nostalgic pulse, wrapped in warm haze and quiet melancholy. Perfect for dusk windows, notebook scribbles, or the feeling of remembering something you can’t quite place."
