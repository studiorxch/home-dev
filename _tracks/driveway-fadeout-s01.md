permalink: /tracks/driveway-fadeout-s01/
description: "A suburban memoryscape set in lo‑fi tones. It opens with the hum of a car fading into distance before echo loops and slowed drums settle into place. A ghost‑like melody rises in the bridge, dissolving into silence pulled down by tape drag. At just 1:31, it feels like the end of a scene — a fleeting cooldown where presence lingers longer than sound."
