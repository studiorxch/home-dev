description: "A minimal electronic track built from tape hiss, glitch FX, and runway-ready synth pulses. Featuring foley-forward beatwork, distorted vocal fragments, and halftime bridge swells, this is fashion show minimalism recast as ambient anxiety."

  [Intro]  
  [clicking heels on marble floor sample + stereo tape hiss]  
  [distorted vocal fragment: “mirror-ready…” panned hard left, chopped]  
  [single-note synth pulse (A) repeats like heartbeat monitor]

  [Verse A]  
  [crisp 4/4 kick + rim-clap combo at 126 BPM — dry, minimal, surgical]  
  [lo-fi bassline: distorted mono pulse with rhythmic stutter]  
  [synth accent: cold FM tone ping every 4 bars]  
  [aesthetic FX: camera flash + zipper foley cuts across beat]

  [Bridge A]  
  [beat drops to halftime with snare reverb bloom]  
  [high-passed vocal loop: “reflections / corrections…” filtered and layered]  
  [texture: high-frequency shimmer like studio lighting]

  [Verse B]  
  [groove thickens with shuffle hi-hats + reversed hat rolls]  
  [bass modulates subtly, swelling on off-beats]  
  [vocal fragment returns: “look away / look closer” — glitch doubled]

  [Bridge B]  
  [melody fades into stereo reverb field, beat pauses]  
  [FX sweep mimics camera lens retracting, clicking once]  
  [tension — but no full drop]

  [Outro]  
  [final beat fades in then tape-clicks to a sudden end]  
  [last sound: synth shimmer cuts mid-phrase like a runway light going out]

  minimal electronic, lo-fi glitch — foley-forward runway pulse, cold FM textures, and ambient suspense built into sculpted silence.
