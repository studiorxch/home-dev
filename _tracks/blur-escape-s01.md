description: "A lo‑fi fragment that runs on fractured urgency. Breath and wind set the tone before warped drums and fast Rhodes layers kick in, chasing momentum through haze. A sudden tape‑pitch spike fractures the flow, collapsing into an ambient static sweep. Fleeting, restless, and unresolved — the sound of trying to outrun your own echo."
