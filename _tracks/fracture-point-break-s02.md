title: Fracture Point Break S02
permalink: /tracks/fracture-point-break-s02/
description: "A slow-burn lo-fi rupture: at 80 BPM, dissonant synth stabs and snare-delay percussion flicker through tape haze; a crackling loop drop fractures the calm before a fading ghost trail — chilled surface, emotional disruption underneath."
