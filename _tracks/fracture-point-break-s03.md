title: Fracture Point Break S03
permalink: /tracks/fracture-point-break-s03/
description: "A slow-motion lo-fi glitch vignette: dissonant synth stabs and snare-delay percussion flicker over a hushed 74 BPM pulse; a crackling loop drop fractures the calm before a fading ghost trail â€” chilled surface, emotional disruption underneath."
