title: Backwards Bloom
permalink: /tracks/backwards-bloom/
description: "“Backwards Bloom” is a dreamy ambient-electronic track with muted reverse piano notes, soft tape hiss, and swirling analog synths. The atmosphere swells with tension while carrying a nostalgic undertone, creating a soundscape that feels both fragile and expansive. Its experimental layering and reverse-flowing motifs evoke the sensation of time folding in on itself — a bloom caught between memory and distortion. A piece for late-night immersion, meditative listening, or cinematic reflection."
