permalink: /tracks/nowhere-shortcut/
description: 'A lo-fi loop with a chaotic skip — Nowhere Shortcut grips and lets go in the same breath.
Built from chopped-up jazz percussion, thick, floor-shaking bass, and a shimmer-detuned bridge, it pulses with fleeting energy. Tire-screech FX open the track, and it dissolves in breathy reverb — a fragment of a memory, glitched in motion.'
