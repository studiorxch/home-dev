title: Fracture Point Break S06
permalink: /tracks/fracture-point-break-s06/
description: "A hush-tension lo-fi glitch vignette: dissonant synth stabs and snare-delay percussion flicker over a 75 BPM drift; a crackling loop drop fractures the calm before a fading ghost trail â€” chilled surface with fault lines underneath."
