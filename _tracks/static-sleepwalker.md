title: Static Sleepwalker
permalink: /tracks/static-sleepwalker/
description: "A lo‑fi ambient drift that feels both restless and unshakable. Broken piano loops fracture against analog bass pads, with gritty tape hiss and faint street ambience weaving in the cracks. Sparse, dusty drums push forward at 162 BPM — urgent but restrained, like walking fast through static‑charged air. Emotional yet unflinching, it’s a track that keeps moving even when the world feels paused."
