title: Submerged Notes
permalink: /tracks/submerged-notes/
description: "“Submerged Notes” is a dreamy lo-fi ambient piece built on muted reverse piano notes, soft tape hiss, and swirling analog synths. The textures drift like waves, creating a reflective, emotional atmosphere. Each layer dissolves gently into the next, evoking nostalgia and warmth — as if submerged in memory itself. A track designed for quiet focus, reflective nights, and moments when sound feels like water."
