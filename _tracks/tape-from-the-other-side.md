title: Tape From The Other Side
permalink: /tracks/tape-from-the-other-side/
description: "“Tape From The Other Side” channels an 80s-inspired lo-fi atmosphere with VHS textures and synthwave haze. The track opens with reversed synth pads and soft tape clicks, layered over ambient hum and subtle VHS hiss. A pulsing bassline echoes the mood of 80s nostalgia, reframed through a mellow lo-fi key. Its short runtime makes it feel like a fleeting memory — cinematic, haunting, and perfect for late-night reflection."
