  [Intro]  
  [delicate vinyl hiss + wind chime sparkle]  
  [soft ambient pad fading in like fog]  
  [tape-saturated field recording: faint wire tension creak, barely audible]

  [Verse A]  
  [lo-fi groove enters with whisper-soft kick + brushed snare]  
  [chord loop: Gmaj7 → Bm9 → Em7, dreamy and unresolved]  
  [sinewave sub-bass gently pulses beneath, like tension under silk]  
  [faint melodic motif (synth) mimicking the sway of many threads]

  [Bridge A]  
  [kick drops out; rim taps echo across stereo field]  
  [synth bloom rises with a modulated flutter, evoking wind through thread]  
  [vocal fragment reversed: “drift...” stretched + layered]

  [Verse B]  
  [groove returns with soft shuffle, layered with granular glitch accents]  
  [multiple melodic threads interlace — plucked tones echoing as if suspended]  
  [ambient swell beneath builds like breath, not climax]

  [Bridge B]  
  [drums muted again — texture only: tape hiss, shimmer, tension noise]  
  [synths evolve to more airy filter shapes, like rising strands]

  [Outro]  
  [everything thins to pad + sub + threadlike echo repeats]  
  [final melodic note stretches and unravels]  
  [tape stop with a single breath of silence]
