permalink: /tracks/fade-out-glow-s02/
description: "“Fade Out Glow: S02” captures an end-of-season mood with lo-fi textures and vinyl glow. The track opens with a final buzzer effect before dissolving into ambient tones and gentle vinyl hiss. Warm, drifting layers carry the verse, while the bridge lifts with an uplifting bend, giving way to an outro that melts into echo. The result is a nostalgic, cinematic loop — a reflective soundtrack for transitions, endings, and quiet moments of closure."
