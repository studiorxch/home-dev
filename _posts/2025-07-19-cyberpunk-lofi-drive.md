Patch 2.3 of _Cyberpunk 2077_ introduced an unexpected gem: **autodrive cinematic mode** — letting players watch the city unfold while lo-fi beats play in the background.

IGN captured the vibe perfectly in their new hour-long video. Rainy streets. Neon blurs. Zero combat. Just drift.

> “Inspired by YouTubers who were already making moody cruise videos using GTA V and modded Cyberpunk…”

Now it’s baked in. And it slaps.

- Lo-fi instrumental grooves with no dialogue interruptions
- Night City lit like a Blade Runner watercolor

- A floating sensation that feels like watching a dream drive itself

Great for:

- Post-midnight stillness

Sometimes the future is loud. But sometimes, it just hums.

This update blends visual poetry with musical calm. It’s more than game footage — it’s playable ambient art. Props to CD Projekt Red for turning player ritual into design.
