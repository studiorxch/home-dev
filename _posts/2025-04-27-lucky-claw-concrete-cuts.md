<p>Lucky Clawâ€™s latest drop, <em>Concrete Cuts</em>, isnâ€™t polished â€” itâ€™s purposeful. This tape lives in the cracks. The hiss of a passing train becomes percussion. A bagel shop bodega bell finds rhythm. Thereâ€™s grit under every loop, and thatâ€™s the point.</p>
<p>Crafted over 9 months of walking New York with a field recorder and no map, <em>Concrete Cuts</em> is a love letter to overlooked noise. It bangs in mono. It skips. It lives and dies on your subway ride.</p>
<p>This oneâ€™s for anyone who ever nodded their head to a steam vent.</p>
