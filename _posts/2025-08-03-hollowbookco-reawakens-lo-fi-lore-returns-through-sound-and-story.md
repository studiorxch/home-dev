# HollowBookCo Reawakens: Lo-Fi Lore Returns Through Sound + Story

**Filed under:** [HollowBookCo](https://studiorich.shop/hollowbookco/)

HollowBookCo began as an experiment in 2012 — books carved into objects of mystery and ritual. In 2025, it reawakens as a mythologized imprint for audible imagination: where books become vessels for **music, story, and visual emotion**.

Once known for physical hollow books, the project now cuts _sound_ into its lore. The relaunch pivots HollowBookCo into a hybrid publisher, ambient label, and archive for moods you can read and listen to.

- **Audio Books (Redefined):** public domain texts layered with lo-fi soundtracks
- **Visual Loop Books:** reels of books opening into surreal dioramas
- **Library Loops:** thematic releases blending story + sound (Dracula’s Study Sessions, Hollow Cats Vol. I)

With this reawakening, HollowBookCo also opens its first ongoing corner:  
**The Reading Room** — a weekly series of atmospheric reads, fragments, and lore.

Each entry appears as a **chapter**, filed like notes on the shelf, exploring the overlap between books, music, and memory.

- Chapter 01 — [A Reading Room for the Music World](/reading-room/2025/08/02/chapter-01-reading-room.html)

This is where the archive breathes: a quiet journal unfolding week by week.

This release marks the start of HollowBookCo’s **Library Sessions**, a growing catalogue of ambient literature loops.

For us, HollowBookCo feels like a sibling archive to StudioRich:

- StudioRich = music-first, visual studio energy
- HollowBookCo = book-first, lore-anchored atmosphere

It’s another shelf in the same creative library.

And with this reawakening, two threads return that make the lore even deeper:

<img src="/assets/ui/catpaws.svg" alt="Link" class="icon-sm"> **Kitty**, the first cat icon in our avatars, comes back as a familiar spirit — stitching HollowBookCo’s earliest days into its future.

<img src="/assets/ui/moon.svg" alt="Link" class="icon-sm"> The visual style, inspired by _Where the Wild Things Are_, rekindles that mix of wonder and shadow, echoing the original magic of 2012 while feeling utterly new.

Together, these elements remind us that HollowBookCo isn’t just relaunching — it’s remembering.
