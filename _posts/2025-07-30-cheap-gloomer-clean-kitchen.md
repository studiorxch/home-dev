# Review: Cheap Gloomer’s _A Clean Kitchen_

Is Self-Deprecating Cowboy-Surf Wizardry

**Filed under:** [Weird Internet Music Culture](/tag/weird-internet/)

When a record gets called “cowboy-surf wizardry,” it’s hard not to lean in. Cheap Gloomer’s _A Clean Kitchen_ is a jangling, self-deprecating ride through lo-fi surf riffs, cowboy twang, and the kind of DIY wizard energy that feels like it could’ve only been summoned online.

Cheap Gloomer’s project thrives in contradiction: cowboy ballads colliding with surf reverb, all tangled up in wry self-awareness. It’s the kind of record that makes you question if it’s parody, homage, or just pure accident — and that’s exactly what makes it stand out.

Tracks tumble between tongue-in-cheek storytelling and surprisingly affecting hooks, giving listeners the sense of finding a bootleg cassette at the bottom of a thrift-store bin — dusty, hilarious, but undeniably alive.

For us, _A Clean Kitchen_ belongs in the same mythic lineage as other **weird internet music culture** artifacts — equal parts joke, spell, and document. It echoes our fascination with sound + visual culture crossovers and sits comfortably in our vault of glitchy lo-fi ephemera.

Like all great lo-fi curios, it doesn’t need to take itself seriously to matter — the magic is in how unserious it feels.
