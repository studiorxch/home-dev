Mac filmed himself walking into the sea in jeans. He lip-syncs with half-lidded grace. He chews an apple. He stumbles through his garden like a man haunted by tenderness.

And over all that, a song floats:

> “Miracle, reveal yourself to me…”

This isn’t a single that wants your attention — it’s a hymn for those who already gave it.

- Ambient indie ballad, stripped and spaced
- Voice just above a whisper, with no pretension
- Clean guitar lines trailing like thought fragments
- Sparse drums like distant footsteps

Somewhere between _Another One_ and _Salad Days_, but even quieter. More surrender than swagger.

There’s beauty in how little this song asks of you. Just show up. Let it play. Let the curse carry on. Let the water touch your jeans.
