After more than eight years of continuous studying, **Lofi Girl** has finally put down her pen, donned a graduation cap, and closed her laptop with a final message that simply read: **“THE END.”**

The moment was revealed in a TikTok clip posted by the official Lofi Girl channel on July 29, 2025. Fans were treated to a bittersweet farewell line:

> _“Finally finished all my homework. I don’t know what I learned, but I know the studying is over.”_

Since debuting in 2015, the **24/7 livestream** (_lofi hip hop radio – beats to relax/study to_) has built a following of more than 15 million subscribers. Lofi Girl became a global companion for late‑night students, remote workers, and nostalgic browsers.

Her “graduation” doesn’t end the stream—it reframes it. The beats continue, but the narrative evolves.
