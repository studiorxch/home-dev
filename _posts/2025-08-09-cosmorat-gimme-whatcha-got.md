Midwest’s Cosmorat twist distortion into introspective lo-fi on their latest single, _Gimme Whatcha Got_. A raw collision of self-destruction and needle-dropped nostalgia, the track morphs shattered melodies into haunting loops. Stunning in its blunt honesty, the soundscape feels like adrenaline trying to catch its breath.

This isn’t lo-fi beauty; it's lo-fi aching.

Haunted guitar drones collide with slow-burning fuzz. Beneath it, a fragile beat stutters like a fractured heartbeat. A voice—cracked and lo-fi-wired—whispers all the way through, pulling you toward fragments of self that don’t want to be saved. There’s an ugliness here that still feels eerily beautiful.

We’re not just listening. We’re in a shared unraveling. Cosmorat doesn’t hide the chaos—they loop it, replay it, and dare you to feel it again. _Gimme Whatcha Got_ is the kind of track that feels visceral as an analog wound.
