When Oxis and Sam Gellaitry sit down to talk music, the conversation bends like a filter sweep. One minute it’s about sardines (the pantry staple), the next it’s a deep dive into the modular labyrinth of sequencers, signal flow, and how tempo maps onto human physiology.

These are artists who see music not just as entertainment, but as an experiment — part physics lab, part poetry session.

Oxis treats a step sequencer like a chef’s knife: precise, essential, endlessly reconfigurable. Sam Gellaitry speaks about rhythm patterns like they’re living organisms — evolving, adapting, responding to the pulse of a crowd.

The sardine talk isn’t random either. Both see food rituals as part of their creative wiring. Late-night sessions, quick pantry fixes, and the comfort of something familiar when you’re 12 hours deep into sound design.

We love this kind of cross-logic: where gear talk sits comfortably beside life’s small joys. It’s exactly the kind of **sound + visual culture crossover** we file away for rainy day loops.

There’s a lesson here too — great electronica is about knowing when to zoom in on the micro-beat, and when to take a step back and share a can of sardines.
