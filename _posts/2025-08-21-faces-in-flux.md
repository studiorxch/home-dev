# Faces in Flux

#### When Vision Fails and Monsters Appear

What if the faces around you suddenly turned demonic—eyes too big, smiles stretched, textures melting off like bad claymation? This isn’t a horror film—it’s **prosopometamorphopsia**, a rare neuro-visual disorder where perception fractures, distorting human faces into terrifying hallucinations.

In her _New Yorker_ feature [“How a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters”](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-rare-disorder-makes-people-see-monsters), journalist **Shayla Love** explores this eerie condition through the stories of people like **Werbeloff** and **Sharrah**, whose everyday encounters became monstrous.

> “The rest of the world looked normal—but the faces didn’t.”

The article blends neurology and narrative like a lucid dream unraveling. These aren’t optical illusions. They’re deeply **felt disturbances of identity**, rendering loved ones unfamiliar, and strangers terrifying. It’s a disorder with no known cure—only adaptation and coping.

For us at StudioRich and HollowBookCo, the article resonates like an ambient chord progression unraveling into noise. What’s more lo-fi than **the brain misinterpreting its most intimate signals**? We began composing a sonic response: a track that captures **faces breaking into fragments**, recognition turning into surreal loops.

In the meantime, pair the reading with:

- This [visual beat loop aesthetic](/tag/visual-beat-loop/) on distortion
- Our [weird internet music culture](/tag/weird-internet/) tag
- Or go deep into the [lo-fi beats loop archive](/tracks/) for sounds to sit with this disquiet

- <img src="/assets/ui/loop.svg" alt="Loop icon" class="icon-sm" /> **Science meets surrealism** — grounded in neurology, but rich with gothic overtones
- <img src="/assets/ui/one-eyed-monster.svg" alt="One eyed monster icon" class="icon-sm" /> **A mirror turned monstrous** — it plays with identity, horror, and misrecognition
- <img src="/assets/ui/speaker.svg" alt="Speaker icon" class="icon-sm" /> **Highly musical** — the sensory collapse invites sonic representation

It’s not just a medical case. It’s a _philosophical glitch_, and an audio-visual mystery that aligns perfectly with our ethos: sound + visual culture crossovers.
