<p>LoFi never sold out — but it definitely signed some contracts. We reimagined Disney’s Max Goof as the poster child for corporate chill — and then ran with it. What started as a quick sketch turned into a full-blown ambient satire loop. Keyboard clicks as percussion. Slack pings reverbing into the abyss. Fluorescent buzz as bassline. Max stares endlessly, studying contracts he’ll never understand.</p>
<p>It’s absurd. It’s soothing. It’s very us.</p>
<p>File under: the best background track for pretending to work in the multiverse.</p>
