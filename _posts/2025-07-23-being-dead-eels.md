“Eels” is deceptively simple — a lofi handshake wrapped in slacker rock and schoolyard chants. But underneath the surface wiggle, there’s a layered musicianship and narrative cleverness that’s rare.

Being Dead leans fully into character. Each track feels like a costume, sometimes cartoonish, sometimes sincerely offbeat. It’s the kind of sound collage you’d overhear at an outdoor puppet show for adults — if that puppet show had a record player and a mic.

This isn’t background music. It’s _weird_ in the best way. It earns your pause.
