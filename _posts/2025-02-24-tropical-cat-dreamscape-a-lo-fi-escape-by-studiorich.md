<p>Sometimes, all you need is a cat in sunglasses and a beat that refuses to leave your head. <em>Tropical Cat Dreamscape</em> isn’t so much a playlist as it is a vacation you forgot you booked. Jungle-toned pads. MIDI marimbas. Laser-washed hi-hats. All purring in sync.</p>
<p>Built as a companion to our digital zine, this mix blends feline memes with VHS aesthetic to create something that shouldn’t work — but absolutely does.</p>
<p>Recommended listening: hammock, coconut water, and an indoor fan set to max.</p>
