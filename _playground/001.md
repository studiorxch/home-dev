  At Canal St., a t-shirt slouches across the railing like leftover thought — soft, creased, and quietly defiant. This subway pause becomes a loop: fluorescent flicker, overhead echo, a beat stitched from urban hush. Our accompanying lo-fi playlist hums beneath the station's grime and rhythm, weaving field recordings, Rhodes chords, and tape-warped drum textures into a soft transit drift — a memory carried in cotton and delay.
