title: “Straight to Canvas” — An East Village Platform Loop
eyebrow: 8th Street
lines: ['R', 'W']
body: >
  From 8th Street station to the art shops downtown, this is the sound of vinyl paint markers, ripped sketchbooks, and lone platform stares. Built for the raw energy of Canal Street's creative runoff, this loop drips with fluorescent rhythm and matte-tone restraint — a nonchalant nod to studio kids, gallery ghosts, and every walking art piece between Astor Place and Canal.
