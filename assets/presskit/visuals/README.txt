🔴 Brand Identity: Whiteout RX-0 / Signal Form

This logo represents our mascot “Whiteout RX-0” mid-run — a signal runner moving between memory and motion. Use it with purpose. Use it with style.

❌ DO NOT

• Stretch, squash, or rotate the mark
• Place it on cluttered backgrounds
• Recolor the red emblem — it's part of our signature
• Add shadows or glows unless part of an approved glitch style
• Use the head scratch as a joke (it’s battle-tested, not comic relief)

📢 NOTES

Whiteout RX-0 is more than a logo — he's our signal. This design lives best when given a little space to run.
